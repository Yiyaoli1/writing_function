```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

## start with something simple

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 3)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec))/sd(x_vec)
```

a function to calculate z_score

```{r}
z_score = function(x){
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("Input must be numeric")
  }
  
  if(length(x)<3){
    stop("Input must have at least 3 numbers")
  }
  z = (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}

z_score(x_vec)
```

try my function on other things, which should have errors.

```{r, error=TRUE}
z_score(3)
z_score("my name is yiyao")

z_score(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))
z_score(c(1,2))
```
